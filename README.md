# Encrypted Notes - Secure Full Stack Web Application

<!-- Include a screenshot or logo here -->

<b>Encrypted Notes</b> is a cutting-edge, full-stack web application that exemplifies my proficiency in web development, REST API design, and cybersecurity principles. This project showcases my commitment to creating a secure and user-friendly note-taking platform.
Key Features

    REST API Architecture: Implemented RESTful APIs based on industry-standard principles, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components. This architecture provides a solid foundation for integrating a variety of functionalities and optimizing user experience.

    JWT Cookie-Authentication: Ensured top-notch security by implementing the latest JWT Cookie-Authentication technique. This guarantees secure user sessions, thwarting unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity.

    Data Encryption at Rest: Spearheaded the implementation of Data at Rest Encryption, a pivotal cybersecurity practice. By employing the powerful Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128-bit strength and double encryption, user note card data is shielded against potential breaches. This practice fortifies user information even when stored in databases.

    User Management System: Developed a comprehensive user management system that empowers users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their note cards. Passwords are fortified using the proven Bcrypt encryption algorithm.

    CRUD Operations & User Profile: Designed an intuitive interface enabling users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on their note cards. Additionally, a dedicated User Profile section allows users to edit their details and upload profile images, enhancing personalization.

    User Profile and Searching: The application features a User Profile section, allowing users to manage their details and upload profile images. Furthermore, the sophisticated searching functionality enables users to search their note cards by Title, Description, and specific date ranges.
